# Offboarding {#offboarding}


Everybody will at some point leave the group. Degrees get completed, jobs are obtained, super exciting! Having a clear offboarding process ensures there are no loose ends when a member leaves the lab, that others who might carry on work being done can do so most easily, and provides an opportunity to clarify any remaining steps (e.g. publication, future collaboartions).
